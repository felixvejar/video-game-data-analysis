# video-game-data-analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis on video game sales data using Python. Includes insights on top platforms, best-selling titles, and genre trends across regions. Built with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn as part of my data analysis portfolio.
This project explores a dataset of video games with the goal of uncovering key insights into sales trends, platform performance, and genre popularity. Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the notebook performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to answer questions like:

Which platforms have the highest number of releases?

What are the best-selling games by region?

How have game releases evolved over the years?

Are there any noticeable differences in popularity between genres?

The dataset includes game titles, release years, genres, publishers, and global/regional sales figures. This project is part of my data analysis portfolio and demonstrates my ability to clean, manipulate, and visualize real-world datasets.
